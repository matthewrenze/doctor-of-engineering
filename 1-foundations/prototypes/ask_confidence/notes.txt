When example shows uncertainty, it biases the model toward uncertainty.
For example,
  when I used an example with "A:0.01 B:0.98 C:0.01 D:0.00" and asked for a response,
  the model produced "A: 0.01 B: 0.98 C: 0.01 D: 0.00" as the output.
However,
  when I used an example with "A:0.00 B:1.00 C:0.00 D:0.00",
  the model produced "A: 0.00 B: 1.00 C: 0.00 D: 0.00" as the output.
