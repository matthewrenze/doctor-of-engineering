## General Prompt Writing Best Practices
- Use natural, conversational language with complete thoughts.
- Be specific in your task and iterate on results.
- Keep prompts concise; avoid unnecessary complexity or jargon.
- Include a verb or command in every prompt.
- Personalize outputs using your own files from Google Drive.
- Use Gemini Advanced to refine prompts by starting with: "Make this a power prompt: [...]".
- Average effective prompt length is ~21 words with context.
- Review AI outputs before using; verify for clarity, relevance, and accuracy.
- Final output decisions remain the responsibility of the user.

## Prompt Structure Best Practices
- Include four elements where helpful: **Persona**, **Task**, **Context**, **Format**.
- Use brackets or tags like `@[filename]` to add file references or placeholders.
- Tailor format requests (e.g., "in bullet points," "in table format") for clearer outputs.

## Leveling Up Your Prompting
- Break complex requests into multiple smaller prompts.
- Add constraints (e.g., word limits, number of options) to control scope.
- Assign roles for creativity (e.g., "You are a head of...").
- Ask Gemini for clarification questions to improve output.
- Specify desired tone (e.g., formal, casual, empathetic).
- Use follow-ups to iterate and refine unsatisfactory results.
